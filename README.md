# TradiShopSite
# E-Commerce Website Project

This is an e-commerce website project that my group and I implemented as part of our college project. We would like to give credit to [Curtis Parham](https://www.youtube.com/@CurtisParhamFreeSkills) for providing an invaluable online tutorial that helped us successfully achieve this project.

## Introduction

In this project, we developed an e-commerce website that allows users to browse, search for products, add them to their cart, and make purchases. It's a comprehensive solution that aims to simulate a real-world online shopping experience.

The primary goal of this project was to create a platform for selling traditional products online, sourced from various regions.

## Features

- **Adding Products:** Easily add new products to the catalog.

- **Archiving Products:** Archive products that are no longer available for purchase.

- **Deleting Products:** Remove products from the catalog.

- **Adding to Cart:** Users can add products to their shopping cart for later purchase.

- **Updating Products:** Make changes to product details, such as price or description.

- **Sorting Products:** Sort products by various criteria, such as price, category, or popularity.

- **Categories:** Products are organized into categories for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

- PHP 7.2+
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- Apache
- MySQL
