Product description

The Traditional Assamese Mekhela Sador is the pride and honour of all Assamese ladies. This is a two piece dress that looks like a Saree but adds a whole lot of style
 and elegance due to its form. Mekhela is worn as the bottom wear which drapes over the petty coat, while Sador, half Saree is drapped on the upper body. 
The Mekhela Sador also brings you the ease of combining multiple colors in a same dress, which traditionally comes with beautiful floral motifs embroidered using
 golden and/or bright colors. This Mekhela Sador comes in big Pink and Blue stripes, over a Goldern Brown backdrop..Also, this Mekhela Sador includes a matching
 blouse piece. We have carefully stitched the Mekhela as well as the borders of the Sador, so that the dress reaches you as a completed set.
