A stunner from runway to hallway, make a bold and beautiful statement in this mind-blowing new silk Rani phi ('silk shawl') design. The large black temple border
 boldly contrasting with the lovely off-white body and interspersed with romantic pastel-colored carnations is all the rage and a definite must-have. Intricately 
weaved by hand, this fresh new design is what’s in this season. Made in Manipur.
