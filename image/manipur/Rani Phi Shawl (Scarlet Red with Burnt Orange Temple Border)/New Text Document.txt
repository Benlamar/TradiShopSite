Who ever said you needed to be in a dress to be a femme fatale, was dead wrong. How about a drop-dead-gorgeous deep red to silence all other shades of red.
 Get ready to be the new Scarlet Lady because this killer inaphi ('shawl') will be an instant hit, all pun intended of course. The soft fabric of the silk glides
 over cloth like gossamer and is sheer enough to show off your favorite blouse and phanek (traditional single-pleated sarong) but the dye's pure wine red shade is
 something only a master of dyes can achieve. The glossy burnt orange moirang kabi ('temple border') complements the phi's ('cloth') beautiful color while the body
 has undulating patterns and charming blue bellflowers that add a sensual appeal. Made in Manipur.
