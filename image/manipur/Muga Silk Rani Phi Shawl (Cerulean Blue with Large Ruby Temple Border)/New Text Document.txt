Agreed, let's just take a moment of silence to appreciate this masterpiece, shall we? Master weavers and dyers; please do refrain from making us overdose with 
unreasonably beautiful colors. This is bad for the heart, girls! The captivating cerulean blue hue of the handmade inaphi ('shawl') manifests all the wonders of
 the sky minus the actual weather (thank goodness!). The silky sapphire veil is complemented by the luminous ruby-colored moirang phijan (‘temple border’) and
 adorned with peony and tulip bulb floral prints in muted blue, yellow, orange, red and purple. You will look divine any which way you twirl! And if you’ve been
 waiting for the right large temple border inaphi to add to your wardrobe, this is the one so don’t miss out! Made in Manipur.
