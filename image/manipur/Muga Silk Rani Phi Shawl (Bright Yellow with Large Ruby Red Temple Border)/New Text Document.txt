Like a magnificent phoenix rising from the ashes, this one is simply out of this world. It's as if the skillful artisans captured the dancing colors of fire and
 decided to weave it into a jaw-droppingly gorgeous inaphi ('shawl'). It has all the fiery essence of a blaze but the scintillating elegance of a flame. The lovely
 arrangement of amaryllis flowers appear in soft orange and blue-grey across the body. The trendy new large temple border is the new sensation and ultra-flattering 
in ruby-red luster. Whether you're wearing it off the shoulder or wrapped around you, you're guaranteed to cause a small commotion! Made in Manipur.
