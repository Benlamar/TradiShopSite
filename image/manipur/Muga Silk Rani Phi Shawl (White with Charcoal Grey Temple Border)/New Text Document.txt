(Full embroidery) Strut your thing and do that little turn on the catwalk. In this number, there's no need for one, the ground under your very feet is the ramp.
 This fabulous creation has winner written all over it. The charcoal grey of the distinctly unique temple border is youthful and edgy yet together with the more 
tempered cool white shade, it redefines elegance. Embroidered in detail across the full expanse of white phi ('shawl') are flirtatious small flowers with long-coiled
 stems in beautiful eye-popping pastel shades. Right said, Fred! Made in Manipur.
